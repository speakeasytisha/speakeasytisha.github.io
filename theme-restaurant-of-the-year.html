        <p>
          Burdell is a modern soul food restaurant in the Temescal neighbourhood of Oakland, California.
          It is named after the chef’s grandmother, and the décor feels like a warm family home from the
          1960s and 1970s, with vintage plates, old-school music and family photos.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chef-owner worked in fine-dining restaurants before opening Burdell. He uses classic Black
          American comfort recipes, but he combines them with local California ingredients and modern
          techniques. The result is “California soul food”: creative dishes that still feel generous and
          familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          The restaurant is very popular, and tables are often booked weeks in advance. A major food magazine
          even called Burdell “Restaurant of the Year”, which brought visitors from all over the United States.

    <section id="review-grammar" class="lesson-section">
      <h2>3. Grammar &amp; style – Past simple in reviews</h2>
      <p>
        When you write a review about a restaurant you visited, use the past simple: <strong>was / were /
        went / ordered / tried / didn’t like / loved</strong>. You can also add adjectives and linking words
        to make the text more fluent.
      </p>

      <div class="grammar-note">
        <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Last weekend, I had dinner</em> at Burdell in Oakland.</li>
          <li><em>The atmosphere was</em> warm and cosy, with vintage décor and soul music.</li>
          <li><em>We ordered</em> several dishes to share, and <em>everything was</em> delicious.</li>
          <li><em>The staff were</em> friendly and professional, and <em>we left</em> a generous tip.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In reviews, we normally talk about a finished visit, so we prefer: <em>was / were / went /
          ordered</em> (past) and not <em>is / are / go / order</em> (present).
