        <h2>2. Reading – A Day in Léa’s Life</h2>
        <p class="yw-tagline">Read the text. Then you can listen to it and do the exercises.</p>
      </header>

      <div class="yw-reading-box" id="yw-main-text">
        <p>
          Léa is thirty-two years old. She works as a project manager in a small company and she is also
          the mother of two young children, Emma who is four and Noah who is eighteen months old. Like
          many young women today, she tries to balance her job, her family and a little time for herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her day starts early. At 6:15 a.m. her alarm rings. She gets up quietly, makes a quick coffee
          and checks her phone. Her calendar is full of coloured boxes: doctor’s appointment for Noah,
          a parent-teacher meeting for Emma, a project deadline at work, and her mother’s birthday in
          the evening. The mental load is already there before the children wake up.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 7 a.m. the house becomes noisy. Emma doesn’t want to get dressed, Noah is hungry, and the
          family cat is meowing for food. Léa prepares breakfast, finds clean clothes, searches for a
          missing shoe and signs a school permission slip. Her partner, Julien, helps when he can:
          he prepares the bottles and puts the laundry in the machine. They both know that if they
          don’t work together, the morning will turn into chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 8:10 a.m. they leave the apartment. First stop: the nursery for Noah. Second stop: the
          kindergarten for Emma. After a quick goodbye kiss, Léa takes the tram to the city centre.
          Sometimes she uses this time to answer messages from her team or to read the news. Sometimes
          she just looks out of the window and breathes for a moment. It is one of the only quiet
          moments of her day.
        </p>
        <p>
          At work, her schedule is tight. She has online meetings, emails to answer and a report to
          finish before Friday. Her boss is friendly but the expectations are high. The company wants
          results and the clients want answers quickly. Léa likes her job; it is stimulating and she
          enjoys working with people from different countries. But some days she feels that the pressure
          never stops, even during her lunch break.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 4:45 p.m. she leaves the office and starts her “second shift”. She picks up Noah and Emma,
          listens to their stories from the day, and stops at the supermarket to buy milk and pasta.
          At home, there is homework, bath time, dinner, and a small fight about which cartoon to watch.
          When the children are finally in bed, Léa looks at the toys on the floor and the emails on her
          phone. She knows she should relax, but she often finishes a few more tasks for work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, she is not alone. On Thursdays, her mother comes to help with the children so
          that Léa and Julien can go for a walk or have dinner together. On some weekends, the
          grandparents take the children to the park so that Léa can meet a friend or simply read a
          book in silence. These small moments of me-time help her to recharge.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she thinks about her grandmother’s life, Léa feels that some things are easier today:
          there are more options for childcare, more possibilities to work part-time or from home,
          and more men who share housework. At the same time, she believes that young women are often
          busier than ever. They want to be good mothers, successful at work, healthy, organised and
          available for their families and friends. Sometimes, this “perfect woman” ideal is simply
          impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, Léa knows she cannot do everything perfectly. But when Emma gives her
          a tired hug and Noah falls asleep on her shoulder, she remembers why she does it. Her life is
          intense and sometimes exhausting, but also rich and meaningful.
