          <p>
            Claire is thirty-two years old and lives in a medium-sized city. She works full-time as an
            assistant manager in a pharmacy. Her job is interesting, but it is also demanding. She checks
            orders, talks to clients, answers emails, and helps the pharmacist with paperwork. Her day
            usually starts at 8:30 a.m., and she often finishes after 6:30 p.m.
          </p>
          <p>
            Claire is also the mother of two children: Léa is eight and Maxime is five. Her partner,
            Thomas, works shifts in a factory, so his schedule changes every week. Because of this,
            Claire spends a lot of time organising the family calendar. On Sunday evening, she takes
            a notebook and writes down who takes the children to school, who picks them up, and who
            cooks dinner on each day.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the week, Claire’s alarm rings at 6:30 a.m. She prepares breakfast, wakes up the
            children and helps them get dressed. At 7:45 a.m. they leave the apartment together. They
            walk to school, then Claire continues to the tram stop to go to work. On the tram, she often
            checks her messages or listens to a podcast about health or parenting.
          </p>
          <p>
            After work, Claire usually feels tired, but the day is not finished. She picks up the children
            from after-school care, goes home, and prepares a simple dinner. While the pasta is cooking,
            she asks Léa about her homework and Maxime about his day. Sometimes she feels she is not
            fully present, because she is still thinking about a difficult client or an urgent email.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Thursday evening, Claire takes Léa to her dance class and waits in a small café nearby.
            She uses this quiet time to plan meals, make appointments and check the family budget. On
            Saturday morning, the family does the shopping together; on Sunday they try to spend a few
            hours outside, walking in the park or visiting Claire’s parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            Claire often feels stressed and worries that she is not doing enough – not enough at work,
            not enough for her children, not enough for herself. At the same time, she is proud of her
            ability to “juggle” many responsibilities. She dreams of working four days a week instead of
            five, to have more time for her children and for herself, but for the moment, the family
            needs her full-time salary.

        <article id="mr-text-b" class="mr-article">
          <p>
            Marie is sixty-three years old and she is a proud grandmother. Her daughter, Julie, is
            thirty-five and has three young children: Lucas is eight, Emma is five, and Noah is two.
            Julie works full-time as a project manager in a small company. Her days are long and
            sometimes very stressful, so Marie tries to help her as much as she can.
          </p>

          <p>
            Two or three times a week, Marie goes to Julie’s house in the afternoon. She picks up
            Lucas and Emma from school and walks with them back home. On the way, they talk about
            their day, their teachers, and their friends. Marie listens carefully and encourages them
            when they have a problem. She also helps Lucas with his homework, especially English,
            because he finds it difficult.
          </p>

          <p>
            At home, Marie often prepares a simple snack for the children and starts to cook dinner
            so that Julie doesn’t have to do everything when she finishes work. She plays with Noah
            while the older children are reading or drawing. Sometimes she feels tired, but she enjoys
            these moments because she can spend real time with her grandchildren, not just say hello
            on the phone.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, Marie also has her own life. She goes to a Pilates class once a week, meets her
            friends for coffee, and looks after her garden. She doesn’t want to replace Julie as a
            mother, but she knows that her presence makes a big difference. When Julie finally gets
            home, they often sit together at the table and talk about their day. Marie feels useful and
            appreciated, and Julie feels less alone in her responsibilities.
