      <h3>Transcript of the phone call</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Anaïs:</strong> Good morning, Anaïs speaking.<br />
        <strong>Peter:</strong> Hello Anaïs, this is Peter Kovács from HungarTech. I'm calling about
        our follow-up meeting scheduled for next Tuesday at three p.m.<br />
        <strong>Anaïs:</strong> Yes, hello Peter. Nice to hear from you. Is there any problem with the meeting?<br />
        <strong>Peter:</strong> Not really a problem, but there is a small issue with the time.
        Three p.m. French time is very late for my team in Hungary. Could we move it to earlier in the day?<br />
        <strong>Anaïs:</strong> I see. Let me check… Would ten a.m. French time work for you?<br />
        <strong>Peter:</strong> Ten a.m. French time is perfect, that’s eleven in Budapest.
        Everyone will still be in the office.<br />
        <strong>Anaïs:</strong> Great. So we move the meeting to <em>next Tuesday at ten a.m. French time</em>.
        I’ll send you a confirmation email with the updated calendar invite.<br />
        <strong>Peter:</strong> Thank you. Could you also add our new project manager, Zsófia
        Tóth, to the invitation?<br />
        <strong>Anaïs:</strong> Of course. Could you spell her email address for me, please?<br />
        <strong>Peter:</strong> Yes, it’s <em>zsofia.toth@hungartech.hu</em>.<br />
        <strong>Anaïs:</strong> Perfect, I’ve got it. You will receive the confirmation in a few minutes.<br />
        <strong>Peter:</strong> Thanks a lot, Anaïs. Have a nice day!<br />
        <strong>Anaïs:</strong> You too, Peter. Bye-bye.

        <p>
          Thank you again for confirming your visit to our head office next Tuesday,
          12 March. I am happy to welcome you and your colleagues from HungarTech.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are expected at <strong>9:00 a.m.</strong> at the main reception of
          Building B. Please ask for me at the desk. I will give you your visitor badges
          and then we will go directly to the meeting room.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 9:30 to 11:00 a.m., we will have a project meeting with our purchasing
          and logistics teams. At 11:15 a.m., I will give you a short tour of our site
          so that you can see the different departments and our production line.
        </p>
        <p>
          For lunch, we have reserved a table in our company restaurant at 12:30 p.m.
          In the afternoon, you will meet our technical team to discuss the next steps
          in our collaboration.
